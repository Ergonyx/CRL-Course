                MY NOTES!
                <p>Hello there!  Here is where I'll be putting all my notes from Kevin Powell's course on Conquering Responsive Layouts!  This page will evolve as I learn more stuff while the files for each days exercises will focus on that days specific topic.</p>

                <div class="lessonTitle">Day 1 - Percentages and Heights</div>
                <p>Leave <span class="ilch">width</span> and <span class="ilch">height</span> alone!  They're responsive by default!  If you MUST change them, use percentages!</p>
                <p style="width: 75%;">The DEFAULT width of a block level element (div, p, h1, etc) is always 100% -- That's 100 PERCENT!  <strong>NOTE:</strong>  Percentages are based on the parent element.  For instance, this paragraph has a <span class="ilch">width</span> of <span class="ilch">75%</span> of the blue box that it is in.  The blue box has a <span class="ilch">width</span> of <span class="ilch">80%</span> of the overall screen space.</p>
                <div class="example">
                    <p class="box">CSS IS AWESOME</p>
                    <p>The example to the left demonstrates the issues mentioned in the paragraphs above and below.</p>
                </div>
                <p style="width: 900px;"><span class="ilch">width: 900px;</span> will not get any smaller (or larger) than that 900 pixels.  This paragraph is a prime example of what could go wrong.  The same applies when setting a <span class="ilch">height</span> except the text will overflow below the element.</p>
                
                <p>By setting the <span class="ilch">width</span> to <span class="ilch">900px</span> the previous line will cause devices with a width of less than 900 pixels to have a horizontal scrollbar.</p>
                <p>Some other responsive units such as <span class="ilch">em</span> and <span class="ilch">rem</span> which will scale things based on the font size of the document <em>(Default is 16px.)</em>  Kevin Powell made a solid video on the <span class="ilch">em</span> and <span class="ilch">rem</span> units <a href="https://youtu.be/_-aDOAMmDHI">HERE!</a></p>

                <div class="lessonTitle">Day 2 - Getting Familiar With Relative Units</div>
                <p><span class="ilch">em</span> and <span class="ilch">rem</span> are relative units of measurement based on the <span class="ilch">font-size</span> of either the parent or root (html) element.</p>
                <p><span class="ilch">em</span> changes based on the <span class="ilch">font-size</span> of the parent element (or reverts to the default of 16px.  <span class="ilch">em</span> also compounds as you go.  Example below.</p>
                <div class="em-parent">
                    <span class="ilch">font-size: 1.1em;</span> is 16 * 1.1 = 17.6px.
                    <div class="em-child">
                        <span class="ilch">font-size: 1.1em;</span> is 16 * 1.1 (P) * 1.1 (C) = 19.36px.
                        <p><span class="ilch">font-size: 1.1em;</span> is 16 * 1.1 (P) * 1.1 (C) * 1.1 (this) = 21.296px.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>You can calculate the <span class="ilch">em</span> equivalent for any pixel value with the formula <span class="ilch">em = desired element pixel value / parent element font-size in pixels.</span></p>
                <p><span class="ilch">rem</span> values were invented to sidestep the compounding problem of <span class="ilch">em</span> units.
                <span class="ilch">rem</span> takes its size from the root (html) element allowing for a standard unit of measurement compared to the calculated <span class="ilch">em</span> units.</p>
                <p>These two buttons are identical except for the units used for padding and margin.</p>
                <div class="btn-vars">
                    <button class="em-btn">Test</button> | <button class="rem-btn">Test</button>
                </div>
